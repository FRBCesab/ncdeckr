## Overview

[Nextcloud Deck](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck) is a kanban style
organization tool aimed at personal planning and project organization
for teams integrated with Nextcloud.

![](reference/figures/README-image.png)

The R package `ncdeckr` is a client to the [Nextcloud Deck
API](https://deck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/). It is dedicated to
manage (list, create, delete, update) boards, stacks, cards and labels.

`ncdeckr` is freely released by the
[FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/).

## Requirements

To use `ncdeckr`, you need to locally store your Nextcloud credentials:

- the URL of the Nextcloud server
- your username on the Nextcloud instance
- an application password

To generate a Nextcloud application password, go to the Settings and
open the Security menu. At the bottom, generate a new app password (use
`ncdeckr` as the app name).

Once your password is created, store your Nextcloud credentials on your
computer. A good practice in [managing
secrets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/secrets.html)
is to store this information as R Environment variables.

Use the function
[`usethis::edit_r_environ()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html)
to open the `~/.Renviron` file and add these three lines:

``` R
NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME='your-username'
NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD='your-password'
NEXTCLOUD_SERVER='https://...'
```

Save this file and restart R.
